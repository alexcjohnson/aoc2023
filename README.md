# Advent of Code 2023

Here are my solutions to all the AOC2023 puzzles. I used Python 3, standard library only. I think all of these work in the form given here for part 2, some of them no longer work for part 1. As [requested by AOC](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about), I've omitted the puzzle inputs and descriptions - this is just my solutions. Most days assume you stored two files, `dayXXtest.txt` and `dayXXinput.txt`. If you want to run against the test file, add `t` to the command, ie `python day13.py t`. To run against the full input, just `python day13.py`
